## Historical Summary

This document originally tracked release/versioning governance work:
- pre-1.0 version baseline (`v0.0.1` initial publish, `v0.1.x` active stream)
- release automation via Release Please
- branch/PR/commit naming governance and CI enforcement
- branch protection requirements for `main`

All active tasks and acceptance criteria now live in the canonical plan above.
