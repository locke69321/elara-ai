# v0.1.0 - Initial Public Publish

## Scope

This release captures the implementation from foundational scaffold through phase-4 documentation delivery.

Included commits:
- `a4b837e` chore(core): bootstrap repository and local uv/pnpm workflow
- `670f5ae` feat(phase2): add dual-mode runtime, policy, and workflow routes
- `93d864e` chore(quality): enforce strict gates and codify outside-in tdd
- `b745cdc` feat(phase3): add security hardening and operability workflows
- `0d74ef9` docs(phase4): add setup, user guides, and backup restore runbook

## What Shipped

### Core platform
- FastAPI monorepo foundation with dual-mode routes and runtime lifecycle.
- Shared contract package and OpenAPI seed documents.
- Worker and event outbox primitives.

### Dual-mode behavior (Phase 2)
- Companion messaging flow with continuity/memory lookup behavior.
- Execution flow with specialist delegation and traceable event timeline.
- Owner/member policy boundaries for specialist management.

### Quality framework (Phase quality hardening)
- Outside-in TDD structure: e2e, integration, unit test layers.
- Red/green/refactor process codified in `AGENTS.md`.
- Enforced gates via `make check`:
  - `make lint`
  - `make typecheck`
  - `make no-any`
  - `make coverage` (>= 90%)

### Security and operability (Phase 3)
- Immutable hash-chained audit events.
- Invitation service and acceptance flow.
- Approval workflow for high-impact specialist actions.
- SQLCipher secure-mode startup enforcement hook.
- Self-host compose baseline and threat model documentation.

### Documentation set (Phase 4)
- `docs/setup/self-hosted-quickstart.md`
- `docs/user-guide/agent-studio.md`
- `docs/user-guide/memory-controls.md`
- `docs/ops/backup-restore.md`

## Validation Status at Publish

- `make check` passing.
- Backend coverage above threshold (>= 90%).
- API and web test suites passing.

## Known Constraints

- Frontend runtime remains scaffold-level (route/UI shells, not full product UI).
- Some phase-3 services are in-memory abstractions pending persistence hardening.

## Recommended Next Focus

1. Persist audit/invitation/approval services to database-backed storage.
2. Wire full web runtime to API endpoints and add user-facing workflows.
3. Add production deployment hardening and observability baseline.
